# Portfolio
The more I was coding my webportfolio following my mockup, the more I thought it looked too simple.
So I decided to add and change I few things alhoutgh the color theme and logo look the same.
I added a carousel in my project page with my pictures. I also changed the home page, putting the pictures 
in different places. 

I had difficulties with my navigation bar as I always do. But I managed to figured out what was the problem. My dropdown menu was not showing up, but tries after tries I figured my code was missing some parts!
I also had a hard time with the carousel, because I did not want it to be full width, so whe I change the size of my pictures it would break the carousel and my pictures were at the left of it. After research only I found out how to fix it.

Resources I used :
1.Bootstrap
